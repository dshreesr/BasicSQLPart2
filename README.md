Here, I have performed operational metrices analysis for a web application.

Overview of tables used for the analysis :

**Table-1: users**
This table includes one row per user, with descriptive information about that userâ€™s account.

**Table-2: events**
This table includes one row per event, where an event is an action that a user has taken. These events include login events, messaging events, search events, events logged as users progress through a signup funnel, events around received emails.

**Table-3: email_events**
This table contains events specific to the sending of emails. It is similar in structure to the events table above.

Please have a look at projects file for details of the queries.
